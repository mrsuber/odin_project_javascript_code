***this is to keep track of different java script code i write as a result of odin***

**javaScript01 is to educate about class syntax**
1. class MyClass {
  // class methods
  constructor() { ... }
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
  method3() { ... }
  ...
}
Then use new MyClass() to create a new object with all the listed methods.

The constructor() method is called automatically by new, so we can initialize the object there.

For example:
**javaScript02 is to educate about class syntax**
1. calculating area of a rectangle or a square
